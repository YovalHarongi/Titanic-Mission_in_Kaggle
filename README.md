Decision Tree Classifier for Titanic Dataset

Introduction:
This project is an implementation of a decision tree classifier for the Titanic dataset. The goal of the project is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as their age, gender, and passenger class.

Installation:
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and the following Python packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

Usage:
The main file of the project is `decision_tree_classifier.py`, which contains the implementation of the decision tree classifier. You can run the file using the following command:

This will load the training and test data from the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files, preprocess the data by filling missing values and encoding categorical variables, fit a decision tree classifier to the training data, and make predictions for the test data. The accuracy of the predictions is printed to the console, along with the confusion matrix and precision and recall scores.

Files:
- `decision_tree_classifier.py`: the main file of the project
- `train.csv`: the training data for the Titanic dataset
- `test.csv`: the test data for the Titanic dataset
